# astergames

A web site for playing games. This is a side project to demonstrate full-stack development with the following tools and technologies:

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) NoSQL database
- [express](http://expressjs.com/) web server framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) UI library
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) JavaScript runtime
- [TypesScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)/[typescript-eslint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)

This project is based on the excellent YouTube series [Learn the MERN Stack](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLillGF-RfqbbiTGgA77tGO426V3hRF9iE) from [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb), with these differences (aside from the fact that it's a different application):

- Written in TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Uses ES6 modules, now fully supported by NodeJS.
- Uses `async`/`await` constructs around the promise-based APIs.
